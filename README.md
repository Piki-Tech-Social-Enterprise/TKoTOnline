## Mihimihi _(Introduction)_
> _Te Kahu o Taonui (TKoT) is a tribal collective that has operated as a vital communications network as a result of Covid 19 to provide high level intel across their respective takiwa communities, share information and utilise TKoT as a conduit for funds and resources to benefit the collective__

TKoT Online is an initiative to build a web portal to support localised responses to COVID 19 by Māori (_Indigenous New Zealand_) for Māori.
